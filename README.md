DESCRIPTION :- NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) research creates knowledge about and treatments for the most chronic, costly, and consequential diseases.

The dataset used in this project is originally from NIDDK. The objective is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Build a model to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not.
 
Dataset Description :- The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable (Outcome). Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and more.

Data Exploration:-

Performed descriptive analysis. Understand the variables and their corresponding values. On the columns below, a value of zero does not make sense and thus indicates missing value:

1- Glucose

2- BloodPressure

3- SkinThickness

4- Insulin

5- BMI

Visually explore these variables using histograms. Treat the missing values accordingly.

There are integer and float data type variables in this dataset. Created a count (frequency) plot describing the data types and the count of variables. 

 

Data Exploration:-

6- Checked the balance of the data by plotting the count of outcomes by their value. Described findings and plan future course of action.

7- Created scatter charts between the pair of variables to understand the relationships. Described my findings.

8-Performed correlation analysis. Visually explore it using a heat map.



Data Modeling:-

1- Devise strategies for model building. It is important to decide the right validation framework. Express your thought process. 

2- Applied an appropriate classification algorithm to build a model.

3- Compared various models with the results from KNN algorithm.

4- Created a classification report by analyzing sensitivity, specificity, AUC (ROC curve), etc.


Data Reporting:

1- Created a dashboard in tableau by choosing appropriate chart types and metrics useful for the business. The dashboard included following:

2- Pie chart to describe the diabetic or non-diabetic population

3- Scatter charts between relevant variables to analyze the relationships

4- Histogram or frequency charts to analyze the distribution of the data

5- Heatmap of correlation analysis among the relevant variables

6-Create bins of these age values: 20-25, 25-30, 30-35, etc. Analyze different variables for these age brackets using a bubble chart.
